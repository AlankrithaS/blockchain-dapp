Blockchain DApp: Simple Storage
This project is a simple Ethereum-based decentralized application (DApp) using Truffle and Ganache. It demonstrates how to deploy a basic smart contract (SimpleStorage.sol) on a local Ethereum blockchain and interact with it through a front-end.

Features
Deploys a simple storage contract to an Ethereum network.
Allows storing and retrieving a number on the blockchain.
Built with Truffle, Ganache, and Web3.js.
Technologies Used
Solidity: Smart contract development.
Truffle: Ethereum development framework.
Ganache: Local Ethereum blockchain for development.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API for interacting with the blockchain.
